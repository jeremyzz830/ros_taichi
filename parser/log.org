#+title: xml Parser

* DONE Have a sample urdf file for testing
* DONE Have a terminal command that take urdf's filename as an input and parser it with a python script.
* TODO Have a =parser.py= file implementing =xml.etree.ElementTree=
- Can python load a urdf file?
  Found =urdfpy= package
  This package works! But may need some modification to adapt it to our project.
* TODO Data grouped by different nodes [0%]
** TODO create abstract classes
** TODO coming soon
** TODO dfc
* TODO Modify =urdfpy= package [33%]
** DONE Learn git submodule
- Add submodule in the main project
  1. Go to the root of the main project
  2. =git submodule add <submodule_url>=
     e.g. =git submodule add https://github.com/JimLiu35/urdfpy.git=
  3. To clone the main project with the submodule use =git clone <main project url> --recurse-submodules=
** TODO =urdf.py=, create a =Robotype= abstract class that only have two values, either "Rigid" or "Soft"
- Modify =urdfpy/__init__.py=. Add class =Taichi, BodyType, MaterialProperty= into (a) =import=, (b) =__all__=
- Extend =urdfpy/urdf.py=. Add class =Taichi=, =BodyType=, =MaterialProperty=

** TODO =urdf.py=, modify =Link= class's =_Element= variable, and add {'robotype': (Robotype, False, False)}, which means the Robotype class is NOT required, and is NOT multiple.

* DONE Ask Jiaming to add an additional collaborator JimLgy

* Environmental setting
** Install [[https://urdfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html][urdfpy]] package
#+begin_src shell
mamba install urdfpy
# pip install urdfpy
#+end_src

* Problems
** Material
For more practical simulation, especially related to soft body robot, I don't think only specify soft or rigid is good enough. Users need to find somewhere to enter material properties. For example, material strength, density, young's modulus, etc.

Could have a tag under <material> that allows users to specify a yaml file containing all the material properties.

* LOG
** July 22, 2023
- Download a bunch of software including necessary software required to run ROS2 smoothly on m1 mac.
  rviz2 can visualize urdf now!
** July 23, 2023
- =urdypy= is installed!
  Error 1: ImportError: cannot import name 'Mapping' from 'collections'
  Solution: The problem persists if I installed urdfpy with pip. However, it is resolved automatically once I used =mamba install urdfpy=. So, it is likely that some dependencies are missing using pip install.
** July 25, 2023
- write a simple zsh script.
  run =tcs filename.urdf=, to load the urdf file into parser.py
